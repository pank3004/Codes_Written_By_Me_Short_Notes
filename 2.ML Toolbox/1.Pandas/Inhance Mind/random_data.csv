Description,"We propose deep observations of two massive galaxy clusters, at redshifts of 1.84 and 1.03, to measure the metallicity of the ICM at very high redshifts. These data will definitively test the early enrichment scenario, in which most of the metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium occurs before clusters form, during the period of maximal star formation and black hole activity, more than 10 Gyr ago. This scenario is supported by high-precision Suzaku measurements of a homogeneous iron distribution in the nearby Perseus cluster, extending to the virial radius. Our proposal will provide a direct and precise test of early enrichment, probing the distribution of iron in our z=1.03 target and the overall, core-excised metallicity of the most luminous, distant cluster known."

Mission Description,"The European Space Agency's (ESA) X-ray Multi-Mirror Mission (XMM-Newton) was launched by an Ariane 504 on December 10th 1999. XMM-Newton is ESA's second cornerstone of the Horizon 2000 Science Programme. It carries 3 high throughput X-ray telescopes with an unprecedented effective area, and an optical monitor, the first flown on a X-ray observatory. The large collecting area and ability to make long uninterrupted exposures provide highly sensitive observations.  Since Earth's atmosphere blocks out all X-rays, only a telescope in space can detect and study celestial X-ray sources. The XMM-Newton mission is helping scientists to solve a number of cosmic mysteries, ranging from the enigmatic black holes to the origins of the Universe itself. Observing time on XMM-Newton is being made available to the scientific community, applying for observational periods on a competitive basis."
